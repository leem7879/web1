<h1>Ed Sheeran - Dive</h1>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Maybe I came on too strong<br>
Maybe I waited too long<br>
Maybe I played my cards wrong<br>
Oh just a little bit wrong<br>
Baby I apologise for it</p>

<p>I could fall or I could fly<br>
Here in your aeroplane<br>
I could live, I could die<br>
Hanging on the words you say<br>
I’ve been known to give my all<br>
And jumping in harder than<br>
10,000 rocks on the lake</p>

<p><strong>So don’t call me baby<br>
<u>Unless you mean it</u></strong><br>
Don’t tell me you need me<br>
If you don’t believe it<br>
So let me know the truth<br>
Before I dive right into you</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">You’re a mystery<br>
I have travelled the world<br>
And there’s no other girl like you, no one<br>
What’s your history?<br>
Do you have a tendency<br>
to lead some people on?<br>
Cause I heard you do</p>

<p>I could fall or I could fly<br>
Here in your aeroplane<br>
I could live, I could die<br>
Hanging on the words you say<br>
I’ve been known to give my all<br>
And lie awake, every day<br>
Don’t know how much I can take</p>

<p><strong>So don’t call me baby<br>
<u>Unless you mean it</u></strong><br>
Don’t tell me you need me<br>
If you don’t believe it<br>
So let me know the truth<br>
Before I dive right into you</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">I could fall or I could fly<br>
Here in your aeroplane<br>
I could live, I could die<br>
Hanging on the words you say<br>
I’ve been known to give my all<br>
Sitting back, looking at<br>
Every mess that I made</p>

<p><strong>So don’t call me baby<br>
<u>Unless you mean it</u></strong><br>
Don’t tell me you need me<br>
If you don’t believe it<br>
So let me know the truth<br>
Before I dive right into you<br>
Before I dive right into you<br>
Before I dive right into you</p>
</body>
