<h1>Ed Sheeran - Happier</h1>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">
Walking down 29th and park<br>
I saw you in another’s arms<br>
Only a month we’ve been apart<br>
You look happier</p>

<p>Saw you walk inside a bar<br>
He said something to make you laugh<br>
I saw that both your smiles were twice <br>
as wide as ours<br>
Yeah you look happier, you do</p>

<p>Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
But ain’t nobody love you like I do<br>
Promise that I will not take it personal baby<br>
If you’re moving on with someone new</p>

<p>Cause baby you look happier, you do<br>
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too<br>
And until then I’ll smile to hide the truth<br>
But I know I was happier with you</p>

<p>Sat in the corner of the room<br>
Everything’s reminding me of you<br>
Nursing an empty bottle <br>
and telling myself you’re happier<br>
Aren’t you?</p>

<p>Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
But ain’t nobody need you like I do<br>
I know that there’s others that deserve you<br>
But my darling I am still in love with you</p>

<p>But I guess you look happier, you do<br>
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too<br>
I could try to smile to hide the truth<br>
But I know I was happier with you</p>

<p>Cause baby you look happier, you do<br>
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new<br>
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do<br>
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you</p>
