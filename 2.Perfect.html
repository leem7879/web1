<h1>Ed Sheeran - Perfect</h1>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">
I found a love for me<br>
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead<br>
Well I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
I never knew<br>
you were the someone waiting for me</p>

<p>Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
Not knowing what it was,<br>
I will not give you up this time<br>
But darling just kiss me slow,<br>
your heart is all I own<br>
And in your eyes you’re holding mine</p>

<p>Baby I’m dancing in the dark,<br>
with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass,<br>
listening to our favourite song<br>
When you said you looked a mess,<br>
I whispered underneath my breath<br>
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight</p>

<p>Well I found a woman,<br>
stronger than anyone I know<br>
She shares my dreams,<br>
I hope that someday I’ll share her home<br>
I found a love, to carry more<br>
than just my secrets<br>
To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
We are still kids, but we’re so in love,<br>
fighting against all odds<br>
I know we’ll be alright this time<br>
Darling just hold my hand,<br>
be my girl, I’ll be your man<br>
I see my future in your eyes</p>

<p>Baby I’m dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening
to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress,
looking so beautiful
I don’t deserve this,
darling you look perfect tonight</p>

<p>Baby I’m dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass,
listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, no I don’t deserve this
You look perfect tonight</p>
</body>
