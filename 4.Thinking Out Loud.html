<h1>Ed Sheeran - Thinking Out Loud</h1>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">
When your legs dont work like they used to before<br>
And I cant sweep you off of your feet<br>
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love<br>
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks</p>

<p>And darling I will be loving you till we're 70<br>
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23<br>
And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<br>
And I just wanna tell you I am</p>

<p>So honey now<br>
Take me into your loving arms<br>
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
Place your head on my beating heart<br>
Im thinking out loud<br>
That maybe we found love right where we are</p>

<p>When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>
And the crowds dont remember my name<br>
When my hands dont play the strings the same way<br>
I know you will still love me the same</p>

<p>Cause honey your soul can never grow old, its evergreen<br>
Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory<br>
Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways</p>

<p>Maybe its all part of a plan<br>
I just keep on making the same mistakes<br>
Hoping that youll understand</p>

<p>But baby now<br>
Take me into your loving arms<br>
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
Place your head on my beating heart<br>
Thinking out loud<br>
That maybe we found love right where we are</p>

<p>So baby now</p>

<p>Take me into your loving arms<br>
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart<br>
Im thinking out loud<br>
That maybe we found love right where we are<br>
Oh maybe we found love right where we are<br>
And we found love right where we are</p>
</body>
